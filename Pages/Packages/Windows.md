### Warning
{: .bg-red-300}

A lot of antivirus vendors detect **Videomass.exe** as malicious. 
Since these are false positives, to resolve this problem the only thing to do is 
to submit the Videomass.exe file to your antivirus vendor for advanced analysis 
and making a False Positive claim. 

Alternatively, install from [PyPi package](Python_Package) or [Run Videomass from source code](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/wiki/Run-Videomass-from-source-code) 


For any other application-related issues, please read 
[Known Problems](../../known_problems) and [Bug Reports](../Bugs) pages.
