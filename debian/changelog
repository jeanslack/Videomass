videomass (3.0.6-1) UNRELEASED; urgency=medium

  * New stable upstream release
  * The directories `MAcOsxSetup/` and `Win32Setup/` are been unified to
    `FFMPEG/` folder and added to package_data of the videomass3 package.
  * On Linux it is now possible to include ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay
    executables into FFMPEG folder. This could be useful, for instance, to make
    an application bundle all-in-one of Videomass for Linux distros
    without ffmpeg installed on (see videomass3/FFMPEG/README).
