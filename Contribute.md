# Can i contribute?

Videomass is [free (libre) software](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Free_software); it needs your contribution!
There are several ways to help the development of Videomass:

---

You can report **Bugs**, **New Features** and **Improvements** by writing in as much detail as possible 
at [Videomass Issues page](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/issues) or email me at <jeanlucperni@gmail.com>

If you want to translate offline, please read

## Packaging
{: .bg-green-300}

A list of Videomass installation packages for Linux is available 
[here](Pages/Packages/Linux). Packaging for other distros still needs to be done. 
Also, I would be very glad if anyone can push Videomass into the official or 
unofficial repositories of any distribution.

User documentation of Videomass is still a work in progress. The source files 
are hosted on [github](https://github.com/jeanslack/Videomass/tree/gh-pages/Pages/User-guide-languages).
