The yt-dlp GUI included in Videomass has been moved to [Vidtuber](https://github.com/jeanslack/Vidtuber), the new GUI aimed only at yt-dlp.

Vidtuber provides exactly the same features developed to date for Videomass, but will also be more user-friendly and already includes various installation methods. Please visit development page for more details and downloads:
