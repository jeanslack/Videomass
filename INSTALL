VIDEOMASS INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS AND BUILDINGS

Notes: On some systems, you may need to replace "python3" with "py" or "python".

==============================
Executable packages availables
==============================

If you are not a developer and just want to install Videomass on your operating
system, please visit the following page:

    https://jeanslack.github.io/Videomass/download_installation.html


=============================
Base application dependencies
=============================

    Requires:
        - Python >=3.9.0
        - wxPython >=4.0.7
        - PyPubSub >=4.0.3
        - requests
        - FFmpeg (included ffplay and ffprobe) >=5.1


=========================
Run from source directory
=========================

Videomass can be run without installing by extracting the source archive
and executing the "launcher" script inside the source Videomass directory.

    cd Videomass (source directory)

    python3 launcher

Videomass can also be imported from the Python3 console (interactive mode):

    >>> from videomass import gui_app
    >>> gui_app.main()


=====================================
Translate the program into your language
=====================================

By default, MO (aka Machine Object) files are not distributed with the
source code and/or the Python sdist package, so the program will not be
fully translated into your language. Compiling the language translation
catalogs must be done on your machine by one of the following options:


-1- Using PoEdit application: <https://poedit.net/>

    Browse the directory corresponding to your language code:
        "videomass/data/locale"
    Open the videomass.po file using PoEdit, then save it (Ctrl+S). This is
    enough to translate Videomass into your native language.

-2- Using GNU-gettext utilities.

    Requires:
        - shell (/bin/bash)
        - msgfmt (from GNU-gettext)

    cd Videomass (source directory)

    ./develop/gettext_utils/generate_MO_files.sh

-3- Using `babel` Python package <https://pypi.org/project/babel/>

    Requires:
        - Python >= 3.9.0
        - pybabel (from `babel` package, installable via pip)

    cd Videomass (source directory)
    pybabel compile --domain videomass --directory "videomass/data/locale"

    To compile a single language file only, add the `--locale` option followed
    by your locale code as argument (e.g. `de_DE`) to pybabel comand line.


* Note that all the options listed above involve exiting and restarting
  Videomass, then setting the proper language from the preferences dialog.


======================
Installation using pip
======================

    -----------------------------------------------------------------------
    If you are a Linux/FreeBSD user, the standard installation procedure
    will not install wxPython, as wxPython's PyPi wheels provides support for
    Windows and MacOS only. Please install wxPython manually using your OS's
    package manager.

    Then, this assumes a virtual environment activated using python-venv
    module with `--system-site-package` option to share wxPython module
    installed in your OS,
    like this:

        python3 -m venv --system-site-packages --upgrade-deps VENV

        source VENV/bin/activate
    ------------------------------------------------------------------------

python3 -m pip install videomass

OR, inside source directory:

    python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
