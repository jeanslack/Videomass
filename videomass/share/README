-----------------------

When you run this app. for the first time, the contents of this folder will
be copied to the user's Videomass configuration directory, according to the
conventions of each operating system which are:

        Linux:       '~/.config/videomass'
        MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'

Furthermore, the Videomass configuration directory is also used to load
files located in the 'presets/' folder. Files format into 'preset' folder is `.prst`.
These files are Videomass presets and contain JSON data type.

UPDATE: >=v3.4.6

To keep all application data inside the program folder, create a folder named
"portable_data" . On MS-Windows, if this folder is in the "appdata" of the
standalone executable, only relative paths will be provided. In all other cases
they will be absolute paths.

AppImage users: If you would like the Videomass*.AppImage to
store its data alongside the Videomass*.AppImage rather than in your home
directory, the AppImage natively has this capability, just enable the
appropriate option, type:

    `$ Videomass*.AppImage --appimage-help`

to view appimage options.
