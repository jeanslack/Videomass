-----------------------

When you run this App for the first time, the contents of this folder will be 
copied to the user's Videomass configuration directory, according to the 
conventions of each operating system which are: 

        Linux:       '~/.config/videomass'
        MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'

Furthermore, the Videomass configuration directory is also used to load the 
files located in the 'presets' folder. The extension of these files is `.prst` 
but they are actually structured with JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) data. 

UPDATE: >=v3.4.6

To keep all application data inside the program folder, you can create a folder 
called "portable_data". On MS-Windows, when this folder exists and is in "appdata", 
only relative paths will be provided. In all other cases they will be absolute paths. 

-------------------
For AppImage users: 
-------------------
WARNING: DO NOT PLACE THE "portable_data" FOLDER INSIDE APPIMAGE !

If you would like the Videomass*.AppImage to store its data alongside the 
Videomass*.AppImage rather than in your home directory, the AppImage natively has 
this capability, just enable this option, like this:
    
`$ Videomass-3.5.7-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-portable-home`

Fo more information type:

`$ Videomass-3.5.7-x86_64.AppImage --appimage-help`
