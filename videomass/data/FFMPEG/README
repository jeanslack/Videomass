========================================
Purpose of the FFMPEG directory
========================================

This directory was created to satisfy the portability needs in case the
Videomass application was completely self-contained in a bundle.

Optionally, it can be used to host a statically compiled build of FFmpeg.
Please note that a static build included in this directory is automatically
selected by Videomass only if FFmpeg is not included in the operating system
environment variables. Otherwise, you can set it in the preferences dialog (see
FFmpeg table).

If you want to use this approach, make sure that your directory tree
looks like this:

    |--------------------------|-------------------------|
    |   **Unix**               |       **Windows**       |
    |--------------------------|-------------------------|

MAcOS
=======================================

The 64bit static builds for MacOS can be downloaded at the official web page:

    - http://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/

If you don't want to use statically compiled builds, leave this folder empty.
You can later use Homebrew to install FFmpeg. Building options and steps can be
found here:

=======================================
MS-Windows
=======================================

The static builds for MS Windows can be downloaded at:

    https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

Building options and steps can be found here:

===============================================================================
For legal reasons (for example: including FAAC for AAC support) it is illegal
to distribute the FFmpeg binary compiled in some countries of the world, for
example, with the FAAC codec for AAC support. The distributable binary of FFmpeg
does not include faac support, which, however, can be obtained from compiling
the source code. If you need the faac codec (or other codecs with special
restrictions) in FFmpeg, you should compile yourself from the source with the
faac codec support.
