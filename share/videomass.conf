# FFmpeg always has one main thread which does most of the processing. 
# In case of multiple inputs there are also input threads for demuxing 
# (1 thread per input); for single input demuxing is done on main thread. 
# Setting "threads N" (where N > 1) on input enables multithreaded decoding 
# which can spawn N additional threads for each decoder which supports it.
# Set the number of threads (from 0 to 32), default 1:
-threads 1

# Quality/Speed ratio modifier
# Contrary to its name, cpu-used doesn’t actually control how much overall 
# CPU is being used, it controls the quality of the encode (ie. how much 
# cpu is used for each frame in total).
# if used set -cpu-used N  - where 'N' is an integer starting from -16 to 16 .
# By default it is Disabled:
Disabled

# !! WARNING !! LOGLEVEL OPTION ffplay/ffmpeg: 
# All FFmpeg output messages are on stderr (excluse ffprobe), and include 
# both information messages and error messages. Videomass does its best to 
# capture the output and log only the output by ffmpeg that is made available 
# by 'loglevel' type option.
# Changing the following logging level would also change the behavior of 
# the output on log messages and error messages.

# Set loglevel option for FFplay
# the 'hide_banner' option is used to limit the output that might be 
# excessive in a window.
error -hide_banner

# Set loglevel option for FFmpeg
# Very important: the -stats option print progress report during encoding, 
# useful for the progress bar and the percentage progress label. 
# Changing the -stats option, Videomass would not work correctly.
# Note that in some cases the -stats option is excluded when a process 
# reading is not required.
warning -stats

# EXECUTABLES BINARY:
# Videomass support custom executables links of FFmpeg, FFprobe and FFplay 
# binaries. These links refer to paths managed by users who want to use 
# other versions of FFmpeg in their user-space. If these options are not 
# used, videomass will use executables installed in the system by default
