[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/jeanslack/Videomass.svg?branch=master)](https://travis-ci.org/jeanslack/Videomass)   

Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed for [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) 
enthusiasts who need to manage custom profiles to automate conversion/transcoding 
processes.   

It is based on an advanced use of presets and profiles in order to use most of 
the [FFmpeg](https://www.ffmpeg.org/) commands without limits of formats and 
codecs.   

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing and processing multimedia 
streams and downloading videos via [youtube-dl](https://youtube-dl.org/).   

Videomass is written in Python3 with the wxPython-Phoenix toolkit.
