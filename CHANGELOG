      See issue #5

    * [APPIMAGE; EXE; APP) Fixed issue with playing online media streams.
      See issue #6

    * [APPIMAGE] Fixed (I hope) missing checkbox on wx.listctrl. This did not
      allow the selection of Format Codes for download. To solve this problem
      it was necessary to install
      'wxPython-4.1.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl' which I had compiled on
      Debian 9 stretch. But it also made useless the work I had done to make
      the AppImage work on Ubuntu14.04 :-(

    * [PRESETS] fixed "For_Archive_Collection.prst" preset where I forgot
      to remove the `-pass 2` parameter on all three profiles.
      Sorry for the mistake.

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
    * Overall improved string search algorithm on 'FFmpeg search topics'
      mini frame and backwards compatible with wxPython < 4.1 .

      youtube-dl and ffplay.

BUGS:
-----
    * Fixed issue during setup wizard not finding ffmpeg executables when

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
    * The directories `MAcOsxSetup/` and `Win32Setup/` are been unified to
      `FFMPEG/` folder and added to package_data of the videomass3 package.

      executables into FFMPEG folder. This could be useful, for instance,
      to make an application bundle all-in-one of Videomass for Linux distros
      without ffmpeg installed on (see videomass3/FFMPEG/README).
