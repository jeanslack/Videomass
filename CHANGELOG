September 12, 2019 V.1.6.1
+------------------------------------+

BUG FIXES:
    * The overwrite message 'file already exists' that appeared when exporting 
      images was fixed

IMPROVEMENTS:
    * enanced errors management on all processes.
    * improved messages on the status of any processes.
    * During the conversion ffmpeg errors will no longer interrupt all 
      other activities in the queue; if an error occurred it will be marked 
      with 'failed' but continue; if it has finished without errors it will 
      be marked with 'completed'. Since not all ffmpeg messages are errors, 
      sometimes it happens to see more output marked with yellow color.
    * The export of images from a movie now has the progress bar and all 
      the normal functions such as process stop and real-time output display.
    * Now to export images you need to select which files to convert in the 
      'Add file' panel (drag and drop).
    * Now the images saved by the movies are named as filename + a progressive 
      number + .jpg.
      All saved images are placed in a folder with the same file name + a 
      progressive number that is saved in the selected output path to avoid
      over writtings.
    * the logging level can now be optional, no longer mandatory the "error"
      flag, since the management of the output and errors has been improved.
    * Changed version to the videomass.conf and videomassWin32.conf to 1.4.
    * When setting the seek point with the duration tool, the cutting time 
      must also be set. Not vice versa.
      
ADD:
    * The option to set the ffmpeg and ffplay loglevel flag has been added 
      to the settings dialog.
    * Added check box to disable or enable the "-cpu-used" flag as sometimes 
      it is not supported and causes more output to read.
    * Added new preset to save images from movie in jpg/png/bmp formats
    * Added "Remove selected file" from the context menu of the Add File panel
      (drag n drop) to remove a selected item with the right mouse button.
    * Added more info data stream to dialog box list when saving the audio 
      from the movie.
    * Now on Preset Manager panel a double click on a profile start the process.
    * Added "-map 0" flag on all video conversion panel commands, to include 
      all streams of imported video on exported video (audio streams, subtitle
      streams, etc.).

REMOVALS and DISPLACEMENTS: 
    * removed the setting to save the log file in another directory chosen 
      by the user since the option to open the log directory had been 
      implemented in the previous version of Videomass.
