      it was necessary to install
      'wxPython-4.1.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl' which I had compiled on
      Debian 9 stretch. But it also made useless the work I had done to make
      the AppImage work on Ubuntu14.04 :-(

      to remove the `-pass 2` parameter on all three profiles.

      progressive number that is saved in the selected output path to avoid
      over writings.

      flag, since the management of the output and errors has been improved.

      all streams of imported video on exported video (audio streams, subtitle
      streams, etc.).

    * removed the setting to save the log file in another directory chosen
      by the user since the option to open the log directory had been
