Sep 17, 2020 V.3.1.0
+------------------------------------+

BUGS:
-----
    * [APPIMAGE] fixed error while playing local files with ffplay.
      See issue #5

    * [APPIMAGE; EXE; APP) Fixed issue with playing online media streams.
      See issue #6

    * [APPIMAGE] Fixed (I hope) missing checkbox on wx.listctrl. This did not
      allow the selection of Format Codes for download. To solve this problem
      it was necessary to install
      'wxPython-4.1.0-cp38-cp38-linux_x86_64.whl' which I had compiled on
      Debian 9 stretch. But it also made useless the work I had done to make
      the AppImage work on Ubuntu14.04 :-(

    * [PRESETS] fixed "For_Archive_Collection.prst" preset where I forgot
      to remove the `-pass 2` parameter on all three profiles.
      Sorry for the mistake.

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
    * Overall improved string search algorithm on 'FFmpeg search topics'
      mini frame and backwards compatible with wxPython < 4.1 .

    * Added some cosmetic and functional improvements.

    * [YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER] Adding first item auto selection to prevent empty
      data view on 'Show More' mini frame.

    * Improved FFmpeg menu.

    * Improved some contexrual descriptions.

REMOVALS, DISPLACEMENTS, REPLACEMENTS:
---------------------------
    * The mpv player has been removed from optional dependencies, as it has
      been replaced by FFmpeg's ffplay to playback online streams.

NEWS:
-----
    * [YOUTUBE DOWNLOADER] New modules to playback online streams via
      youtube-dl and ffplay.

    * A tmp/ directory has been added in the cache/ directory for temporary
      files downloaded for preview playback.

    * Added new checkbox on Settings dialog box to clear or keep cached data.

    * Added new checkbox on Settings dialog box to disable permanently
      warnin message if youtube-dl executable is no longer in use.

    * [APPIMAGE] youtube_dl python package is been included on AppImage.

    * [APPIMAGE] It is possible to update the youtube_dl Python package if
      included in AppImage. New tools have been made for this task.

    * [APPIMAGE] Videomass has been split into two specific versions, one for
      GTK2 and the other for GTK3.

+------------------------------------+

BUGS:
-----
    * Fixed issue during setup wizard not finding ffmpeg executables when
      included in FFMPEG folder (specially for MacOS and Windows application
      bundles).

IMPROVEMENTS:
-------------
    * The directories `MAcOsxSetup/` and `Win32Setup/` are been unified to
      `FFMPEG/` folder and added to package_data of the videomass3 package.

    * On Linux it is now possible to include ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay
      executables into FFMPEG folder. This could be useful, for instance,
      to make an application bundle all-in-one of Videomass for Linux distros
      without ffmpeg installed on (see videomass3/FFMPEG/README).

BUG FIXES:
    * The overwrite message 'file already exists' that appeared when exporting
      images was fixed

IMPROVEMENTS:
    * enhanced errors management on all processes.

      other activities in the queue; if an error occurred it will be marked
      with 'failed' but continue; if it has finished without errors it will
      be marked with 'completed'. Since not all ffmpeg messages are errors,
      sometimes it happens to see more output marked with yellow color.
    * The export of images from a movie now has the progress bar and all
      the normal functions such as process stop and real-time output display.
    * Now to export images you need to select which files to convert in the
      'Add file' panel (drag and drop).
    * Now the images saved by the movies are named as filename + a progressive
      number + .jpg.
      All saved images are placed in a folder with the same file name + a
      progressive number that is saved in the selected output path to avoid
      over writings.
    * the logging level can now be optional, no longer mandatory the "error"
      flag, since the management of the output and errors has been improved.
    * Changed version to the videomass.conf and videomassWin32.conf to 1.4.
    * When setting the seek point with the duration tool, the cutting time
      must also be set. Not vice versa.

ADD:
    * The option to set the ffmpeg and ffplay loglevel flag has been added
      to the settings dialog.
    * Added check box to disable or enable the "-cpu-used" flag as sometimes
      it is not supported and causes more output to read.
    * Added new preset to save images from movie in jpg/png/bmp formats
    * Added "Remove selected file" from the context menu of the Add File panel
      (drag n drop) to remove a selected item with the right mouse button.

      from the movie.
    * Now on Preset Manager panel a double click on a profile start the process.
    * Added "-map 0" flag on all video conversion panel commands, to include
      all streams of imported video on exported video (audio streams, subtitle
      streams, etc.).

REMOVALS and DISPLACEMENTS:
    * removed the setting to save the log file in another directory chosen
      by the user since the option to open the log directory had been
      implemented in the previous version of Videomass.
