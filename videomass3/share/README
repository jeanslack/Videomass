-----------------------

When you run the program for the first time, the contents of this folder will
be copied to the user's Videomass configuration directory, according to the
conventions of each operating system which are:

        Linux:       '~/.config/videomass'
        MacOs:       '~/Library/Application Support/videomass'
        Windows:     'C:\Users\username\AppData\Roaming\videomass'

`videomass.conf` is Videomass main configuration file and is used to store
user preferences and to import essential data for the application.

Furthermore, the Videomass configuration directory is also used to load
the presets inside the 'presets/' folder. All presets files have the format
extension `.prst` and contain text with JSON data structure.

UPDATE:

From 29 August 2021 (specifically from Videomass v.3.4.4), the possibility of
keeping all application data inside the program folder is introduced. This
feature can only be implemented with stand-alone (preferably portable)
executables created with pyinstaller, and currently includes
Videomass_portable.exe for Windows and Videomass.app for MacOS.

AppImage users: If you would like the Videomass*.AppImage to
store its data alongside the Videomass*.AppImage rather than in your home
directory, the AppImage natively has this capability, just enable the
appropriate option, type:

    `$ Videomass*.AppImage --appimage-help`

to view appimage options.
