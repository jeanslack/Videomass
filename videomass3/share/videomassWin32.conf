# Version number of this configuration file:
# Changing the version number, make sure it matches the version number
# in the "vdms_sys/configurator.py" file in `get_fileconf` method.
# This will automatically replace the old version of the configuration
# file with the new one on the user configuration directory
2.3
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# Set up a custom user directory for saving files:
none
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# FFMPEG always has one main thread which does most of the processing.
# In case of multiple inputs there are also input threads for demuxing
# (1 thread per input); for single input demuxing is done on main thread.
# Setting "threads N" (where N > 1) on input enables multithreaded decoding
# which can spawn N additional threads for each decoder which supports it.
# Set the number of threads (from 0 to 32), default 1:
-threads 4
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# WARNING: This section sets fundamental parameters that influence
#          the behavior of FFMPEG and Videomass. **Handle with Care**
#
# -loglevel  FFMPEG output messages are on stderr (excluse FFPROBE); Videomass
#            uses 'loglevel' option to capture and redirect output to log.
#            Changing the following logging level would also change the behavior
#            of the output on log messages and error messages.
#
# -stats  print progress report during encoding, useful for the progress bar
#         and the percentage progress label. If missing the -stats option,
#         Videomass would not work correctly. Note that only in some cases the
#         -stats option is explicitly excluded on the code.
#
# -hide_banner  is used to suppress printing initial informations of FFMPEG

# -nostdin  it disables interaction on standard input since Videomass uses
#           FFMPEG as background process.

# Set loglevel and options for FFPLAY:
-loglevel error -hide_banner

# Set loglevel and options for FFMPEG:
-loglevel warning -stats -hide_banner -nostdin
#---------------------------------------------------------------------#
#
# EXECUTABLES BINARY:
# Videomass support custom executables links of FFMPEG, FFPROBE, FFPLAY
# and MPV binaries. These links refer to paths managed by users who want to
# use other versions of FFMPEG in their user-space. If these options are not
# used, videomass will use executables installed in the system by default

# Activation FFMPEG executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of FFMPEG:
ffmpeg.exe

# Activation FFPROBE executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of FFPROBE:
ffprobe.exe

# Activation FFPLAY executable (boolean values = true/false):
false
# executable path-names of FFPLAY:
ffplay.exe

# Set icon themes map:
Material_Design_Icons_black

# Set toolbar color in RGB values:
118, 118, 118

# Set tollbar buttons color in RGB values:
176, 176, 176, 255

# Set Buttons Font Colour in RGB values:
0, 0, 0
#
# Clear cached data during application exit (temporary files only)
true
