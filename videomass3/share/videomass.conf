#-------------------------- 1- Versions ---------------------------------------#

# Updated: March 31 2021
#
# Changing the version number, make sure it matches with version number
# in the "vdms_sys/configurator.py" file in `get_fileconf` method.
# This will automatically replace the older version of the configuration
# file with the new one.
# Version number of this configuration file:
3.0

#-------------------------- 2- FFmpeg dest. folder ----------------------------#

# Set up a destination folder for transcoding files with FFmpeg, `none` or
# absolute `pathname` to folder, e.g. on Unix: /home/user/myfiles .
# See also the section -9 below.
none

#-------------------------- 3- ffmpeg Transc. threads -------------------------#

# FFMPEG always has one main thread which does most of the processing.
# In case of multiple inputs there are also input threads for demuxing
# (1 thread per input); for single input demuxing is done on main thread.
# Setting "threads N" (where N > 1) on input enables multithreaded decoding
# which can spawn N additional threads for each decoder which supports it.
# Set the number of threads (from 0 to 32), default 4:
-threads 4

#-------------------------- 4- Loglevels and stdin opt. -----------------------#

# WARNING: This section defines some important parameters that affect the
#          behavior of FFMPEG and Videomass. **Handle with Care**
#
# -loglevel  FFMPEG output messages are on stderr (excluse FFPROBE); Videomass
#            uses 'loglevel' option to capture and redirect output to log.
#            Changing the following logging level would also change the behavior
#            of the output on log messages and error messages.
#
# -stats  print progress report during encoding, useful for the progress bar
#         and the percentage progress label. If missing the -stats option,
#         Videomass would not work correctly. Note that only in some cases the
#         -stats option is explicitly excluded on the code.
#
# -hide_banner  is used to suppress printing initial informations of FFMPEG

# -nostdin  it disables interaction on standard input since Videomass uses
#           FFMPEG as background process.

# Set loglevel and options for FFPLAY
# available loglevels: `quiet`, `fatal`, `error`, `warning`, `info`
# (default `error`)
-loglevel error -hide_banner

# Set loglevel and options for FFMPEG
# available loglevels: `error`, `warning`, `info`, `verbose`, `debug`
# (default `warning`)
-loglevel warning -stats -hide_banner -nostdin

#-------------------------- 5- FFmpeg executables -----------------------------#

#  If the FFmpeg executables are invalid file names, the wizard dialog will
#  be displayed.
#  Note that the absolute file name must be provided, eg. `/usr/bin/ffmpeg`.
#  The absolute name of the binaries is no longer supported by Videomass
#  version 3.3.5.

# With `true` the user enable local FFMPEG executable otherwise `false`
false
# Executable pathname of FFMPEG, `none` or `pathname`. Pathname must be
# absolute to executable, e.g. on Unix: /home/user/ffmpeg .
none

# With `true` the user enable local FFPROBE executable otherwise `false`
false
# Executable pathname of FFPROBE, `none` or `pathname`. Pathname must be
# absolute to executable, e.g. on Unix: /home/user/ffprobe .
none

# With `true` the user enable local FFPLAY executable otherwise `false` .
false
# Executable pathname of FFPLAY, `none` or `pathname`. Pathname must be
# absolute to executable, e.g. on Unix: /home/user/ffplay .
none

#-------------------------- 6- GUI setup --------------------------------------#

# Set icon themes map:
Videomass-Colours

# Set toolbar icon size (usually 16, 24, 32, 64):
24

# Set toolbar position. 0 placed on top side; 1 placed at the bottom side;
# 2 placed at the rigth side; 3 is placed at the left side.
0

# Enable text alongside toolbar buttons (values are `show` or `hide`):
hide

#-------------------------- 7- Cache and temporary folder ---------------------#

# Clear cached data during application exit, delete temporary files only,
# `true` or `false`, with true enable clear cached data.
true

#-------------------------- 8- youtube-dl preferences -------------------------#

# Downloader preferences (sets youtube-dl behavior during application startup),
# needs one of the following fields: `disabled`,` local`, `false` or `system`,
# where disabled means not load anything, local indicates a local executable,
# system indicates a python package installed by a package manager and false
# starts wizard dialog.
false

#-------------------------- 9- FFmpeg outpput file saving ---------------------#

# Save the FFmpeg output files in the same source folder (`true` or `false`)
false

# Additional suffix assignment to output files, `none` or only alphanumeric
# characters; hyphen and underscore possible; blank spaces are not allowed.
none

#-------------------------- 10- youtube-dl output file saving -----------------#
