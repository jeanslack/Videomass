Videomass is a cross-platform GUI designed for FFmpeg enthusiasts who need to
manage custom profiles to automate transcoding processes.

It is based on an advanced use of presets and profiles in order to use most of
the FFmpeg commands without limits of formats and codecs.

It features graphical tools for viewing, analyzing and processing multimedia
streams and downloading videos via youtube-dl.

Videomass is written in Python3 with the wxPython-Phoenix toolkit.
