Purpose of the FFMPEG directory
========================================

This folder can optionally host static builds of ffmpeg, ffprobe and ffplay,
which will ONLY BE USED if no FFmpeg is installed in the OS. While it is
generally not recommended to use this approach, it can be useful, for instance,
to make a Videomass bundle (e.g. via pyinstaller or AppImage, etc.) that can be
run in standalone mode embedding FFmpeg binaries without need to install
anything else.

In all other cases FFmpeg will be found in environment variables when
installed in the OS or found by links setted by the user through the
Videomass setup dialog box.

If you want to use this approach, be sure to make a `bin/` folder within ffmpeg,
ffprobe and ffplay binaries, like this:

MAcOS
=======================================

The static builds for MacOS with Intel 64bit can be downloaded at:

    - http://www.evermeet.cx/ffmpeg/

If you don't want to use statically compiled builds, leave this folder empty.
You can later use Homebrew to install FFmpeg. Building options and steps can be
found here:

=======================================
MS-Windows
=======================================

The static builds for MS Windows can be downloaded at:

    https://www.gyan.dev/ffmpeg/builds/

=============================================================================
For legal reasons (for example: including FAAC for AAC support) it is illegal
to distribute the FFmpeg binary compiled in some countries of the world, for
example, with the FAAC codec for AAC support. The distributable binary of FFmpeg
does not include faac support, which, however, can be obtained from compiling
the source code. If you need the faac codec (or other codecs with special
restrictions) in FFmpeg, you should compile yourself from the source with the
faac codec support.
