URGENCY: to do soon
--------------------

--------------
URGENCY: high

- Improve message dialog with URLs inside, i.e. using `wx.lib.agw.hyperlink`.
  [ffplay_url_exe.py, Videomass version, youtube-dl update]
- If the videomass version is higher than the official released one, the ID
  should be beta
--------------

Need code refactoring

-------------
URGENCY: low
-------------

- Crop filter: Make combobox to choose other colors for the crop
  rectangle selection.

- Youtube-Downloader: With "default" option it downloads the best quality
  precompiled video, which isn't the best quality overall. With "download
  audio and video splitted" it downloads the best quality a/v streams.
  ...but these are also default behaviors on youtube-dl ?!

URGENCY: medium
