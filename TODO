Consider automatically opening the log window to the specific log when errors are reported (e.g. volumedetect, etc.).

- When the user selects one of the files in `File List`, opening any dialog box with the same file list as `File List` causes the selected file to be automatically selected, for example see source stream properties.

- If you plan to refactor code and make it compatible only for wx.Python>=4.1.1:
  - then erase `TestListCtrl` class on `formatcode.py` file.
  - Also check all code that starts with `wx.version()` keywords.
  - Erase these block codes along any py-files:

        try:
            from wx.svg import SVGimage
        except ModuleNotFoundError:
            pass

  However, note that these operations leads to make Videomass code incompatible
  for wxPython4.0.7
