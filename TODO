--------------------
URGENCY: to do soon
--------------------

- Make a log during ffplay_url

- Fix the log names (because now there are no more executables)

- [YOUTUBE-DOWNLOADER] Fix Console window during download [Windows] #38 (invalid)

--------------
URGENCY: high

- [TEXT DIALOGS] Improve message dialog with URLs inside, i.e. using `wx.lib.agw.hyperlink`.
  [ffplay_url_exe.py, Videomass version, youtube-dl update]

- [CODE IMPROVING] Need code refactoring

- [MINI FRAMES] change some mini-frame to dialog to make more confortable re-size adjustment.

- Use a context manager to handle all modal dialogs. See setup dialog example
  and apply it to video filters as well.

---------------
URGENCY: medium
----------------

-------------
URGENCY: low
-------------

- Crop filter: Make combobox to choose other colors for the crop
  rectangle selection.

- Youtube-Downloader: With "default" option it downloads the best quality
  precompiled video, which isn't the best quality overall. With "download
  audio and video splitted" it downloads the best quality a/v streams.
  ...but these are also default behaviors on youtube-dl ?!
