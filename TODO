URGENCY: to do soon

URGENCY: high

- Windows: MSVCR100 is required to use youtube-dl.exe with Videomass
  compiled with pyinstaller. If MSVCR100 has not been installed, the
  Videomass functions related to youtube-dl may generate unclear problems
  to the user.
  To avoid this you may need to improve the error messages and prevent
  youtube-dl from installing and updating if MSVCR100 is not installed.[FIXED]

Need code refactoring

- Crop filter: Make combobox to choose other colors for the crop
  rectangle selection.

- Youtube-Downloader: With "default" option it downloads the best quality
  precompiled video, which isn't the best quality overall. With "download
  audio and video splitted" it downloads the best quality a/v streams
