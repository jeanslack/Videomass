- If you plan to refactor code and make it compatible only for wx.Python>=4.1.1:
  - then erase `TestListCtrl` class on `formatcode.py` file.
  - Also check all code that starts with `wx.version()` keywords.
  - Erase these block codes along any py-files:

        try:
            from wx.svg import SVGimage
        except ModuleNotFoundError:
            pass

  However, note that these operations leads to make Videomass code incompatible
  for wxPython4.0.7
