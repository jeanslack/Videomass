- Crop filter: Make combobox to choose other colors for the crop
  rectangle selection.

- Youtube-Downloader: With "default" option it downloads the best quality
  precompiled video, which isn't the best quality overall. With "download
  audio and video splitted" it downloads the best quality a/v streams. [FIXED]
